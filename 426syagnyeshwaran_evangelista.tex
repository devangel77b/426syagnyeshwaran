I am \adjective\ to recommend \firstname\ \lastname\ for admission to the NJ Governor's School in the Sciences (GSS). \firstname\ is a current student in my Science \& Engineering AP Physics C Mechanics class. I have known \firstname\ for one semester. Although this time is short, I am very familiar with the Science \& Engineering magnet program \subject\ is in, as I am also a graduate of the program; and I attended the NJ Governor's School in the Sciences in 1993. \firstname\ has the same level of interest in science and intensity that I recall from my classmates in GSS `93. 

\firstname\ is highly motivated in the fields \subject\ is interested in and takes on leadership positions in order to push \possessive\ peers to excel. For example, \firstname\ is a leader of the both the school trivia club and the district Hackathon. In my class, I have directly observed this as \subject\ is always the leader of her physics lab group. I have observed \firstname's preparations for the upcoming district Hackathon, and I am impressed at how she plans her engineering efforts and how she works systematically and thoroughly towards goals, especially goals of educating her classmates and creating meaningful experiences for them. I observed the same when she led a bridge design exercise for our Science \& Engineering freshmen earlier this year. 

\firstname has broad interests in... stuff... and some bullet points here...

The Science \& Engineering program that \firstname\ is in is a very rigorous magnet program in which students take advanced science and mathematics courses as preparation for STEM majors. As you can see from \possessive\ transcripts, \firstname\ is concurrently in several other challenging classes including AP Computer Science and AP Calculus BC... and some other bullet points that go nicely here. I believe \subject\ would contribute greatly to GSS.
